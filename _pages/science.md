{% include base_path %}

All of my research is centred around studying T cell receptors (TCRs) and their interaction with antigens, peptide-MHC complexes (pMHC). 


TODO
    ADD REFERENCES/PICTURES WHERE AVAIABLE?

FUNCTIONAL SCREENING AT REPERTOIRE SCALES

INCREASING BREADTH OF COVERAGE TO MAKE FINDINGS GENERALISABLE/EQUITABLE
    

INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF TCR SEQUENCE DIVERSITY (ESP GENOMIC VARIABILITY)


EXPLORE THE USE OF REPERTOIRE CHARACTERISTICS TO INFORM CLINICAL PRACTICE, E.G. IN CASES OF ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
