Here are links to some of the tools and resources I've made for various tasks in TCR research.

|                           **Tool / Resource**                            | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|           [`stitchr`](https://github.com/JamieHeather/stitchr)           | Generate full-length coding TCR sequences from V/J/CDR3 classifiers, for functional validation or high-throughput modelling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|           [`autoDCR`](https://github.com/JamieHeather/autoDCR)           | Flexible V/J/CDR3 annotation from deep sequencing data. A custom fork of [the Chain lab's Decombinator tool](https://github.com/innate2adaptive/Decombinator), that matches tags along the entire length of TCR variable domains, allowing full allele-level determination, and other more niche applications (e.g. novel allele/splice detection). |
|    [`immunoseq2airr`](https://github.com/JamieHeather/immunoseq2airr)    | Convert Adaptive Biotech's immunoSEQ format TCR data to the [Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire-Community (AIRR-C) standard format](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/stable/datarep/rearrangements.html).                                                                                                                                        |
|        [`IMGTgeneDL`](https://github.com/JamieHeather/IMGTgeneDL)        | Automated downloading of TCR/IG sequences from [`IMGT/GENE-DB`](https://www.imgt.org/genedb/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|   [`genedb-releases`](https://github.com/JamieHeather/genedb-releases)   | Banked snapshots of the entirety of [`IMGT/GENE-DB`](https://www.imgt.org/genedb/) (i.e. both TCR and IG, all species/loci), to allow comparison between versions and reproduction of historical analyses.                                                                                                                                          |

|   [`airrc2hlaguessr`](https://github.com/JamieHeather/airrc2hlaguessr)   | Convert [AIRR-C format data](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/stable/datarep/rearrangements.html) into that required for [`HLAGuessr`](https://github.com/statbiophys/HLAGuessr).                                                                                                                                                                 |
