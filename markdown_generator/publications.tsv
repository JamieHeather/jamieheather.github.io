2009-06-01	The Epstein–Barr virus lytic cycle activator Zta interacts with methylated ZRE in the promoter of host target gene egr1	Journal of General Virology	My *first* first author publication: EBV, EMSAs, and EGR1.		zta-egr1	Heather_2009_JGV_EBV_Zta_EGR1.pdf	10.1099/vir.0.007922-0	This was my first paper, from my master's work in the Sinclair lab at Sussex. This investigated the binding of the EBV transactivating Zta protein to the host human *EGR1* gene. We used EMSAs to identify which of the prospective sites were bound most readily, factoring in this protein's ability to preferentially bind to methylated response elements.		
2013-01-09	Decombinator: a tool for fast, efficient gene assignment in T-cell receptor sequences using a finite state machine	Bioinformatics	Decombinator, for TCRseq annotation.		decombinator	Thomas_2013_Bioinf_Decombinator.pdf	10.1093/bioinformatics/btt004	This was my first publication in the Chain lab at UCL, being the PhD work of my mathematician labmate Niclas Thomas. Nic wrote the first version of Decombinator, the lab's script for annotating TCR rearrangements from deep sequencing data - using the key innovation of using unique tag sets to populate Aho Corasick tries to identify V and J genes. My primary contribution was to develop capacity for processing alpha chain data to complement the beta chain functionality that already existed.		
2015-10-13	Computational analysis of stochastic heterogeneity in PCR amplification efficiency revealed by single molecule barcoding	Scientific Reports	Inter-molecular stochasticity in PCR.		pcr-stochasticity	Best_2015_SciRep_PCR_stochasticity.pdf	10.1038/srep14629	This paper was primarily the work of labmates Katharine Best and Theres Oakes (in the dry and wet lab respectively), showing that unique molecular identifiers allow detection of unequal amplification of *even identical* DNA molecules in a PCR. I [discussed this in a blog nearer the time](http://jamimmunology.blogspot.com/2015/11/heterogeneity-in-polymerase-chain-reaction.html), but I like to include it as it's a nice reminder to myself to chase up interesting findings: this line of inquiry in the group came out of us musing over some of my results in lab meetings, going over observations I'd made as I was piloting the first version of our UMI-barcoded TCRseq protocols.		
2016-01-10	The sequence of sequencers: The history of sequencing DNA	Genomics	DNA sequencing technology review.		dna-sequencing	Heather_2016_Genom_DNA_Sequencers.pdf	10.1016/j.ygeno.2015.11.003	This was my *first* first author paper to come out of my PhD, spun out of what became the introduction for one of my thesis chapters. It's very simply a review of the history of DNA sequencing, taking a brief look back at a field which often instead looks forward to the next big thing. In it I also discuss a formalised view of the first three generations of DNA sequencing technology, and highlight some of the key researchers and technologies of each.\n\n\nThis is a paper that I wrote with the intention that it would be of particular use to students new to the field, and I'm particularly proud that it seems to have met that goal. After publication it rapidly became (and I believe still remains, years later) the journal's most downloaded and most cited paper, and one of the most cited reviews on the topic to date.		
2016-01-11	Dynamic Perturbations of the T-Cell Receptor Repertoire in Chronic HIV Infection and following Antiretroviral Therapy	Frontiers in Immunology	TCRseq of chronically infected HIV patients.		hiv-tcrseq	Heather_2016_FrontImmuno_HIV_TCR_RepSeq.pdf	10.3389/fimmu.2015.00644	This was the major biological paper of my PhD, and the first place we applied the error-correcting TCRseq amplification and analysis pipeline we had developed.\n\n\nIn it I demonstrated the profound impact that chronic untreated HIV infection has upon the TCR repertoire, surprisingly driven more by CD8 clonotype expansion rather than CD4 depletion.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA258001	https://github.com/JamieHeather/tcr-analysis
2017-10-12	Quantitative Characterization of the T Cell Receptor Repertoire of Naïve and Memory subsets Using an Integrated experimental and Computational Pipeline Which Is Robust, economical, and Versatile	Frontiers in Immunology	The Chain lab TCRseq pipeline.		tcrseq-protocol	Oakes_2017_FoI_TCRseq-Protocol.pdf	10.3389/fimmu.2017.01267	The culmination of many years work from many people, this is the first formal publication describing the TCR sequencing protocol and pipeline I helped develop at the Chain lab in UCL. This improves upon the previous protocol as was using in my 2016 Frontiers in Immunology paper with various technical innovations, permitting both easier and more robust amplification and barcode-mediated error-correction. This paper also describes how to analyse the TCR sequences produced using the third version of our Decombinator TCR analysis suite. 	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA390125	
2019-12-06	Murine xenograft bioreactors for human immunopeptidome discovery	Scientific Reports	Developing murine xenografts for immunopeptidomics.		murine-xenografts-immunopeptidomics	Heather_2019_SciReports_Murine-Xenograph-Immunopeptidomics.pdf	10.1038/s41598-019-54700-2	This was one of the projects from my postdoc time with Mark Cobbold. Unfortunately his unexpected departure for industry meant that several projects were cut short, but I was glad that we were able to round off this section into this study, showing that immunodeficient mice can be used to grow large quantities of human cancer cell lines for the purposes of immunopeptidomics – which is especially useful when studying rare MHC antigens like phosphopeptides.	https://github.com/JamieHeather/xenoimmunopeptidomics.	
2020-08-27	Decombinator V4: an improved AIRR-C compliant-software package for T-cell receptor sequence annotation	Bioinformatics	Decombinator version 4.		Decombinator-4	Peacock_2020_Bioinf_Decombinator-v4	10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa758	This collaborative effort represents significant updates to the Decombinator code base, bringing it up to Python 3, improving error correction, and making output compatible with AIRR-C standards.		https://github.com/innate2adaptive/Decombinator
2022-03-24	Stitchr: stitching coding TCR nucleotide sequences from V/J/CDR3 information	Nucleic Acids Research	Stitchr for generating full coding TCR sequences.		stitchr	Heather_2022_NAR_Stitchr.pdf	10.1093/nar/gkac190	Stitchr is the culmination of efforts started during my time in the Cobbold lab, during which I was designing some TCR sequences the old-fashioned way – i.e., by hand. As this is a highly manual process, even for someone that spends as much time looking at TCR sequences as I do, I thought it would be a nice idea to automate it. This also would hopefully provide a robust repeatable and reproducible way to produce TCR sequences, which if you’ve ever dug around in supplementary tables and patents etc looking for sequences to clone, you will appreciate the need for.\n\n\nAfter I popped my initial sparse function on Github people started using it, and collaborators started asking me to make TCR sequences for them. When Mark left for industry and I transitioned into Aaron Hata’s lab I found myself needing even more sequences, so I built it out into a full package, which I am very gratified to see is becoming somewhat popular among people that do both functional TCR cellular assays and in silico TCR bioinformatics and predictions.	https://github.com/JamieHeather/stitchr-paper-analysis	https://github.com/JamieHeather/stitchr
