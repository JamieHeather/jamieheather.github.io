This was the major biological paper of my PhD, and the first place we applied the error-correcting TCRseq amplification and analysis pipeline we had developed.


In it I demonstrated the profound impact that chronic untreated HIV infection has upon the TCR repertoire, surprisingly driven more by CD8 clonotype expansion rather than CD4 depletion.
