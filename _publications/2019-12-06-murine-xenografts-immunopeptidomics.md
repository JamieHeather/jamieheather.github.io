This was one of the projects from my postdoc time with Mark Cobbold. Unfortunately his unexpected departure for industry meant that several projects were cut short, but I was glad that we were able to round off this section into this study, showing that immunodeficient mice can be used to grow large quantities of human cancer cell lines for the purposes of immunopeptidomics â€“ which is especially useful when studying rare MHC antigens like phosphopeptides.
