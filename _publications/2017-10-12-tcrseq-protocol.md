The culmination of many years work from many people, this is the first formal publication describing the TCR sequencing protocol and pipeline I helped develop at the Chain lab in UCL. This improves upon the previous protocol as was using in my 2016 Frontiers in Immunology paper with various technical innovations, permitting both easier and more robust amplification and barcode-mediated error-correction. This paper also describes how to analyse the TCR sequences produced using the third version of our Decombinator TCR analysis suite.
