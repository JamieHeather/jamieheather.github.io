This was my first paper, from my master's work in the Sinclair lab at Sussex. This investigated the binding of the EBV transactivating Zta protein to the host human *EGR1* gene. We used EMSAs to identify which of the prospective sites were bound most readily, factoring in this protein's ability to preferentially bind to methylated response elements.
